	fs.writeFile(path,data,callback):
	fs.appendFile(path,data,callback):
	fs.unlink(path,callback):
	fs.mkdir(path,callback):
callback:-its a function passed as an arguement in another function.

callback Function:-
it is a nodejs function that is passed as an arrgument to another function 
it is a fundamental concept of asynchronous programming in nodejs.
	characteristics:-
	 asynchronous
	 error handling
concept of Asynchronous programming:-
1> Non blocking Execution:
2> Event loop:
	i> handle asynchronous operation by listning for Event & dispatching their crossponding callback
3> callback Function
4> Promises


API : A piece of software that can be used by another piece of software

REST API :
	> Seperate API into logical resources.
		> Resources : object or representation of something, ehich has data assosiates to it
	>Expose resource-based URLs, use HTTP methods 

	> be state less : 
		> Stateless RESTful API: al state is handled on the client side . this means that each must containsall the information necessary to the process a certain request.
		> The server should not have to remember previous request.
